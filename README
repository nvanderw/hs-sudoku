This sudoku solver takes at least one command-line argument, each specifying the
name of a file with a sudoku puzzle in it. The first 9x9 = 81 digit characters
of this puzzle file will be used to fill in its internal puzzle array
row-by-row. So, a sensible human-and-machine-readable format might look like:

000003017
015009008
060000000
100007000
009000200
000500004
000000020
500600340
340200000

The zero digit denotes an empty square. Upon completion, the program will print
out for each puzzle either an indication of failure or the state of the solved
puzzle.
